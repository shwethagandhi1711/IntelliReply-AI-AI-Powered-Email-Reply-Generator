Dear [Sender Name],

Thank you for reaching out and for your meeting request.

I sincerely apologize, but I regret that I will be unable to make the proposed meeting time work due to a prior commitment/an unforeseen scheduling conflict. I am truly sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.

I am very keen to connect and discuss this further, and I would be very grateful if we could explore an alternative time or date that works for both of us. Please let me know if there are other times that might suit you in the coming days, or if you prefer, I can suggest a few options.

Thank you for your understanding and flexibility.
